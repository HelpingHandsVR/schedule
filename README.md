# Helping Hands Schedule

This repository handles generation of the schedule manifest based on a template.

The `main` branch contains the template and the compiling code, which is manually authored.

The `deploy` branch contains automatically generated commits by GitHub Actions that produce the schedule manifest. These are regenerated each time the template is updated, or at regular intervals, so that they can be consumed and displayed in other locations (e.g. VRChat or the Discord server).

Please contact me (Devon) if you want guidance on how to use this.
